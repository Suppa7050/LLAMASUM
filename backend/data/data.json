If an attack is\nunrecognized, the system intelligently identifies it as a \"zero-\nday\" attack, highlighting its potential novelty and enabling\nproactive threat detection to eliminate possible attacks, protect\nsystems, and safeguard against emerging security threats. The\nbackend was built using Python and FastAPI, while the front end\nwas developed with React, providing a user-friendly interface\nfor efficient and effective cybersecurity monitoring.\nTech stack:  Python, FastAPI, React, Cicflowmeter, and machine   \n                       learninghttps://www.linkedin.com/in\n/dhanunjaya-suppa/CERTIFICATIONS\nNPTEL-Python for Data Science -Top 1%\nNPTEL-The Joy of Computing      -Top 5%\n        using Python                                      \nNPTEL-Programming In JavaNew Spectrum:\nDeveloped \"New Spectrum,\" a dynamic MERN project that\nserves as a platform for connecting individuals with ideas and\nsolutions. This innovative application allows users to upload\ntheir problem statements and receive answers from others,\nfostering collaboration and knowledge sharing. Additionally,\nregistered users can contribute by uploading their ideas to\nexisting problem statements shared by others. The project\nshowcases proficiency in the MERN stack, including MongoDB, \nExpress.js, React, and Node.js, as well as a strong\nunderstanding of user interaction and database management.\nTech Stack: Mongo, Express, React,NodeHOBBIES\nReading books\nGaming\nLLAMASUMM:\nThe project 'Unlocking the Power of Llama-2 for Local Multi-\nDocument Summarization' follows a systematic workflow.\nInitially, it ingests multiple PDF documents as input and\nemploys cosine similarity to assess correlations among them.\nSubsequently, utilizing DBSCAN, the system clusters\ncorrelated documents, forming coherent groups of related\ninformation. To handle sizable clusters, a recursive text splitter\nis utilized, effectively segmenting large sets into manageable\nchunks. Finally, leveraging the capabilities of the Llama-2\nmodel, each cluster or chunk undergoes a summarization\nprocess, generating concise and informative summaries.\nTech Stack:  LLAMA-2,Colab, Qlora, Streamlit, Flask, e.t.c\nEXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES\nAs a founding member and Club Head within the team behind\n'Curiosity,' I played a pivotal role in establishing and leading a\nvibrant collegiate forum.
